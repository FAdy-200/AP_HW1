the submitted code is made by me and only me
i spent a good amount on this assigment because i did a GUI for it and i made both games
what take the most time was the GUI i was done with the backends in less than 2 hours but i took time because this is
the first time i do anything with GUI

please leave all files in their respected place as they are either images or needed for the GUI or codes
d
you will find the GUI and the backend of each game in it's folder with the images needed for the GUI
